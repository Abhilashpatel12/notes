### üõ°Ô∏è Comprehensive Security Implementation

This application was built with a security-first mindset, incorporating multiple layers of protection against common web vulnerabilities.

#### 1. Rate Limiting

* **General Routes:** 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP.
* **Authentication Routes:** Stricter limit of 20 requests per 15 minutes per IP.
* **Configurable:** Settings are managed via environment variables.

#### 2. HTTP Security Headers (Helmet)

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Controls which resources can be loaded to prevent XSS attacks.
* **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):** Enforces the use of HTTPS.
* **X-Frame-Options & X-Content-Type-Options:** Protects against clickjacking and MIME-sniffing.

#### 3. Input Protection & Sanitization

* **NoSQL Injection Prevention:** Uses `express-mongo-sanitize` to strip malicious characters from user input.
* **HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP):** Prevents parameter pollution attacks.
* **Request Size Limits:** Imposes a 10MB limit on request payloads.

#### 4. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

* **Origin Control:** The API is strictly configured to only accept requests from the deployed frontend URL.
* **Credentials Support:** Allows secure transmission of authentication headers.

#### 5. Authentication & Authorization

* **JWT-based Authentication:** Secure, stateless token system with a 1-day expiration.
* **Password Hashing:** Uses `bcryptjs` with a salt round of 10.
* **Protected Routes:** Server-side middleware ensures only authenticated users can access note data.

#### 6. Request Logging & Monitoring

* **Development & Production Logging:** Provides detailed request logging tailored for different environments.
* **Error & 404 Tracking:** Logs all failed requests and errors for monitoring.

#### 7. Secure Error Handling

* **No Information Disclosure:** Production error messages are generic and do not leak sensitive stack traces or system information.

#### 8. Data Protection

* **Password Security:** Passwords are never stored in plain text and are excluded from all API responses.
* **OTP Security:** One-Time Passwords are used for verification and are cleared from the database after use.

#### 9. Server Hardening

* **Graceful Shutdown:** The server is configured to shut down gracefully, preventing data corruption.
* **Error Handling:** Catches and handles unhandled promise rejections and uncaught exceptions.
